    "Let's break it down step by step to help you understand the output and how it relates to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target:\n",
    "In this dataset, the target variable is `Purchased`, which tells us whether a person purchased something (likely an ad click or product purchase) or not. \n",
    "- **0**: The person did not purchase (no).\n",
    "- **1**: The person did purchase (yes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Goal:\n",
    "We used an SVM model to predict whether a person will purchase or not based on their **Age** and **EstimatedSalary**. The target was to correctly classify people as \"Purchased\" (1) or \"Not Purchased\" (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Accuracy**:\n",
    "- **Accuracy: 0.9125** means that the model correctly predicted the outcome (purchase or not) **91.25%** of the time on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Classification Report**:\n",
    "This report gives you deeper insights into how well the model performed for each class (Purchased = 1 or Not Purchased = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For Class 0 (Not Purchased):\n",
    "- **Precision**: 0.90\n",
    "  - This means, when the model predicted \"Not Purchased\" (0), it was correct **90% of the time**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Recall**: 0.98\n",
    "  - This means, out of all the actual \"Not Purchased\" cases, the model correctly identified **98%** of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1-Score**: 0.94\n",
    "  - This is the balance between precision and recall. It combines them into one number. An F1-score of 0.94 is a good result, showing the model is performing well at identifying people who did not purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For Class 1 (Purchased):\n",
    "- **Precision**: 0.94\n",
    "  - When the model predicted \"Purchased\" (1), it was correct **94% of the time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall**: 0.73\n",
    "  - This means, out of all the actual \"Purchased\" cases, the model correctly identified **73%** of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1-Score**: 0.82\n",
    "  - This shows that for predicting \"Purchased\", the model's performance is good but not as strong as for \"Not Purchased\". The lower recall here means the model misses some of the actual purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Macro Average**:\n",
    "- **Precision**: 0.92\n",
    "- **Recall**: 0.86\n",
    "- **F1-Score**: 0.88\n",
    "  - These averages give an overall performance score, treating each class (0 and 1) equally. The model has a solid balance of precision and recall across both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Weighted Average**:\n",
    "- **Precision**: 0.91\n",
    "- **Recall**: 0.91\n",
    "- **F1-Score**: 0.91\n",
    "  - These averages give more weight to the classes with more samples. In this case, class 0 (\"Not Purchased\") was more frequent, so the weighted scores are close to the overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Our target**: Predict whether a person purchased something (1) or not (0) based on their age and salary.\n",
    "- **What we got**: \n",
    "  - The model does a **great job** of predicting \"Not Purchased\" with high accuracy (90% precision and 98% recall).\n",
    "  - The model's prediction for \"Purchased\" is decent but not perfect (94% precision but only 73% recall), meaning it sometimes misses actual purchases.\n",
    "  - Overall, the accuracy of **91.25%** is good, and the model performs well for both classes, but it can be improved for detecting purchases more reliably.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 1: **Import Libraries**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `pandas`: Used for handling data in a structured form (DataFrames).\n",
    "- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations (like creating arrays).\n",
    "- `train_test_split`: Splits the data into a training set and a testing set.\n",
    "- `StandardScaler`: Standardizes the data (scales features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1).\n",
    "- `SVC`: Support Vector Classification model from scikit-learn.\n",
    "- `accuracy_score`, `classification_report`: Used for evaluating the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: **Load the Dataset**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/Social_Network_Ads.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `pd.read_csv`: Loads the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: **Select Features and Target**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = dataset.iloc[:, [2, 3]].values  # Features (Age and EstimatedSalary)\n",
    "y = dataset.iloc[:, 4].values      # Target (Purchased)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `X`: Features (input data). We are selecting the **Age** and **EstimatedSalary** columns (index 2 and 3) to predict if someone will purchase (target `y`).\n",
    "- `y`: Target variable, which is the **Purchased** column (index 4). It contains the output we are trying to predict (0 for No, 1 for Yes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: **Split the Data into Training and Test Sets**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `train_test_split`: This function splits the data into training and testing sets. \n",
    "  - **`X_train`, `y_train`** are the features and target for training.\n",
    "  - **`X_test`, `y_test`** are the features and target for testing.\n",
    "  - **`test_size=0.25`** means 25% of the data is reserved for testing, and the rest (75%) is used for training.\n",
    "  - **`random_state=0`** ensures the split is reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: **Feature Scaling**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sc = StandardScaler()\n",
    "X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "X_test = sc.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **StandardScaler**: Scales the features so they have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "  - `fit_transform(X_train)`: Fits the scaler to the training data and transforms it.\n",
    "  - `transform(X_test)`: Transforms the test data based on the scaler fitted to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: **Train the SVM Classifier**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "classifier = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=0)\n",
    "classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **SVC**: Creates a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Here, we're using a **linear kernel** (simpler version of SVM), which assumes that the classes can be separated by a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions).\n",
    "  - `kernel='linear'`: Specifies that we’re using a linear kernel for SVM.\n",
    "  - `random_state=0`: Makes the results reproducible.\n",
    "  - `fit(X_train, y_train)`: Trains the model on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: **Make Predictions**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`predict(X_test)`**: Uses the trained classifier to predict the target values for the test data (`X_test`).\n",
    "- The result (`y_pred`) is an array of predicted values (0 or 1) based on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: **Evaluate the Model**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Classification Report:\")\n",
    "print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)**: Calculates the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted values (`y_pred`) with the actual values (`y_test`).\n",
    "- **classification_report(y_test, y_pred)**: Provides a detailed evaluation of the model’s performance for each class, including:\n",
    "  - **Precision**: How many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive.\n",
    "  - **Recall**: How many of the actual positive cases were correctly predicted as positive.\n",
    "  - **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall (harmonic mean).\n",
    "  - **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Recap:\n",
    "- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: A machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks that tries to find the best line (or hyperplane) to separate the classes.\n",
    "- **Standardization**: Important when using SVM, because SVM relies on distances between data points, and scaling helps the model converge faster and more effectively.\n",
    "- **Accuracy & Classification Report**: Provide a measure of how well the model is performing, looking at both overall accuracy and specific metrics for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Output:\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model (in your case, 91.25%).\n",
    "- **Classification Report**: Provides detailed metrics for each class (Not Purchased and Purchased), allowing you to evaluate the model's performance more thoroughly.\n",
